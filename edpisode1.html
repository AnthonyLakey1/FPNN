                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4"><br>Robert Glenn Johnson Jr. Better known as “Junior Johnson” was born and raised in Ronda, North Carolina on June 28, 1931. <br><br>He was the son of a bootlegger (Robert Glenn Johnson) who spent a third of his life in prison. Junior grew up around both racing and illegal liquor running in his early childhood years. <br><br>The middle child of seven, Robert Glenn Johnson, Jr. was immersed in the business and lifestyle as early as 4-years-old, when federal agents raided his home and removed hundreds of gallons of illegal moonshine in 1935. His father, Incarcerated for the same trade that would propel Junior to become one of the most iconic NASCAR drivers in the history of the sport.<br><br>Junior once stated in an interview regarding his early childhood: “We slept on some of the cases. My father wouldn’t put it outside where somebody could steal it. He had the upstairs plumb full of whiskey. All except the kitchen and the dining room was full of whiskey. [The police] came in and toted it out in the yard and busted it up. Upstairs they put some planks on the steps, and they’d just slide it down. Me and my brother—I was about five, he was about six—when they’d put those cases on the slide, we’d jump on top and ride ’em to the bottom. And they got to cussin’ us, “You darn young’uns get out of here.” We’d cuss them back, “It’s our house, you get out.”<br><br>Junior always had a fascination with automobiles, displaying a unique and natural talent for handling them at high speed, which he further finessed to outgun law enforcement while running ‘shine. Johnson is credited with inventing the “Bootleg Turn,” an adrenaline-inducing move in which the driver would slam on his breaks, turn the car 180 degrees and put the pedal to the metal in the opposite direction!<br><br>To evade unwanted attention, his cars would maintain a normal exterior, while the interior was fitted with high-powered engines, as well as heavy-duty springs and shocks.<br><br>By 1955, Johnson wanted to apply his spectacular driving skills to a different line of work, beginning his career as a NASCAR driver. While running in practice at Daytona International Speedway in Florida, he realized he could get in the slipstream of faster cars and keep up with them because of the vastly reduced wind resistance, a technique known as “drafting.” With some skill, he could then slip out of the draft and pass the leading car, which was exactly what he did to win the Daytona 500 in 1960. Despite winning five races in his first full season, Johnson maintained his prior career, and was arrested for having an illegal still, serving 11 months in prison from 1956-1957. <br><br>“I come home from racing in Vermont. I won a race up there. I drove all the way home, and I got in about four o’clock in the morning. My dad had not fired up the still, and you have to fire it up before daylight so the smoke will be gone—when the fire gets hot it quits smoking. Anybody sees the smoke, they know it’s a still. I reached down to shovel the coke to throw it in the burner, and I heard something behind me. One of the officers had slipped up there and got on a box of beer, and he was fixin’ to jump right on my back. I just throwed that shovel of coke in his face and took off running. I got away from him, but they had 18 officers around the still. Two of them caught me. I got caught in an electric fence.”<br><br>Junior was later pardoned on December 26, 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, <br><br>“To all those whom these presents shall come, Greeting: Be it known, that this day the president has granted unto Robert Glenn Johnson JR. also known as Junior Johnson, a full and unconditional pardon and has designated, directed and empowered the deputy attorney general as his representative to sign this grant of executive clemency to the above who was convicted in the united states district court for the middle district of North Carolina on an Indictment (doc number 4265-w) charging violation of section 5601, title 26, united states code, and on November 27th, 1956, was sentenced to two years imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000. In accordance with these instructions and authority I have signed my name and caused the seal of department of justice to be affixed below and affirm that this action is the act of the president being performed at his direction. Done at the city of Washington, District of Columbia on December 26th, 1985”<br><br>Before Junior got into driving, he was an average baseball player. Junior stated “I wouldn’t have ever been a race car driver if I hadn’t broke my arm. I was already along to where I was throwing a baseball at 16 years old 90 miles an hour. I threw a ball that had a certain quickness at the plate. I didn’t know which side it was going to go. And then I turned the tractor over on the farm and broke my arm. I could never throw a baseball again.”<br><br>In his 14-year career, he won 50 races and placed in the “top ten” 148 times before retiring in 1966. In 1992, Johnson was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame, and later inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2007, Johnson became a part owner of Piedmont Distillers, a distillery in Madison, North Carolina. They partnered together to create "Midnight Moon," a legal version of the famous family recipe.<br><br>In 1994, Junior married Lisa Johnson, they started a family with their daughter Meredith Suzanne (b.1995) and son Robert Glenn Johnson III (b. 1993), both of whom attended Duke University. Johnson built a new home for his family in 1997, selling in 2012 because of poor health.<br><br>After growing up in a toxic family business and serving 11 months in prison, and winning many races, Junior passed away on December 20, 2019 in Charlotte North Carolina at the age of 88.  <br><br>His legacy still lives on today. “Midnight Moon” , his family recipe of midnight moonshine, is still sold today. <br><br>Join me next week as we introduce someone who went from robbing stores To playing a "Bad Guy" Actor in several films.<br><br>This has been FPNN UNCOVERED<br></p>
